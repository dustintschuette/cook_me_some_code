For your edu game project, use this readme to state your *project's goals* and **what you will be proposing to build**.
You'll also be using the readme to provide seperate page that will contain an analysis of what you are focusing on, and to provide findings for your project.

Project Name: Cook me some code

Project Goals:
1) build a fun and interactive game
2)The game will be played by dragging answers into blanks in order to make the specified order
3) The probelms should be presented as cafe orders which the user will complete for points/money
4) Have users feel they learned something while enjoying the game
5) The ascetics of both the game, food items, and customers will draw in the user making the experience more fun and engaging.

Please also make sure to **setup the three milestones** in zenhub to represent the sprints.  Each sprint will last a week.
The first milestone will be sprint #1 and will go from wednesday to wednesday
Each sprint will last a week (it's ok to have the dates overlap, since we will finish one sprint and start the next).
